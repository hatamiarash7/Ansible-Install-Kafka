# Install Kafka Cluster ( Ansible )

You can use this role to install a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) cluster on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

By default we have some PVCs here to manage data, so you should define `/mnt/kafka` & `/mnt/zoo` directories on suitable nodes.

> You can ignore this and make it ephemeral.

## How-to

First you need instal the role:

-   Clone this role:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:hatamiarash7/Ansible-Install-Kafka.git install_kafka
    ```

-   Or you can install using galaxy:

    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy install hatamiarash7.install_kafka
    ```

Then, Include role in Playbook:

```yml
- hosts: all
    roles:
        - hatamiarash7.install_kafka
```

## Dependencies

You need **Docker** & **Kubernetes**. Take a look at these roles too:

-   [install_docker](https://github.com/hatamiarash7/Ansible-Install-Docker)
-   [install_kubernetes](https://github.com/hatamiarash7/Ansible-Install-Kubernetes/)

## Usage

We have two service for Kafka and two for ZK.

-   A headless service to create DNS records
-   A Normal service for clients

You can use `bootstrap` service to handle connections between your apps and Kafka cluster.

## Monitoring

The Java virtual machine (Java VM) has built-in instrumentation that enables you to monitor and manage it using the **Java Management Extensions (JMX)** technology. These built-in management utilities are often referred to as _out-of-the-box_ management tools for the Java VM. You can also monitor any appropriately instrumented applications using the JMX API.

We have a second container in every Kafka POD to handle this.

```yml
- name: metrics
  command:
      - java
      - -jar
      - jmx.jar
      - "5556"
      - config.yml
  ports:
      - containerPort: 5556
```

Later, you can use this container to monitor your Kafka cluster.

> Update [13-metrics-config.yml](/files/manifests/kafka/13-metrics-config.yml) to configure metrics.
